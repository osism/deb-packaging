# deb-packaging

Sometimes we like to use more recent versions of projects than are
included in Ubuntu. We build these ourselves here. This also makes
it easier to include hotfixes when needed.

Currently, the following projects are included. In the future, more
projects will be added as needed.

* Open vSwitch
* open-iscsi
